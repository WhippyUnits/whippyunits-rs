# WhippyUnits

A zero-cost, pure rust units-of-measure library for applied computation.  Works on stable Rust.

## Quick Start

```rust
use whippyunits::{quantity, qty, value};
use whippyunits::api::rescale;

let d1 = quantity!(1.0, m);
let d2 = quantity!(500.0, mm);

let sum: qty!(m) = d1 + rescale(d2);
assert_eq!(value!(sum, m), 1.5);
```

WhippyUnits supports `no_std` (disable the default `std` feature) and Serde serialization with UCUM-compliant unit strings out of the box.

## Why WhippyUnits?

Most units-of-measure libraries normalize values to a base unit at construction time — `1 km` is stored as `1000.0 meters`.  WhippyUnits takes a different approach: **scale is encoded in the type, not baked into the stored value**.  `1 km` is stored as `1.0` with kilometer-scale encoded in the type system.  As a result, WhippyUnits features:

- **Scale-explicit arithmetic**: Cross-scale operations like `m + mm` are compile errors, not silent conversions.  You write `rescale()` at every conversion point, making the cost and intent visible in code review — libraries that silently auto-convert hide both the conversion cost and the question of which scale wins
- **Scale-generic arithmetic**: Easily write functions that are constrained by dimensionality but work with any scale, *without* imposing arbitrary rescaling at API boundaries - no numerical flexibility cost compared to raw numeric type contracts
- **No homotypes**: Prime-factorized scale encoding guarantees that if two quantities represent the same physical thing, they are the same Rust type — there are no equivalent-but-distinct type aliases to trip over
- **First-class fixed-point support**: Integer storage types work naturally at any scale — `1_i32.centimeters()` stores `1`, not `0` (in a normalize-to-base-unit library, it becomes `0`, truncated from `0.01 meters`).  Integer rescaling uses pure rational arithmetic with no hidden floating-point
- **No hidden flops**: Rescaling uses lossless log-scale arithmetic at all steps, and exponentiates by lookup table; floating point types use no more float math than necessary, and normalizing to a base unit cannot introduce floating-point error because values stay at the magnitude you declared

WhippyUnits also features:

- **First-class angular units**: Most libraries treat angles as dimensionless, which means angular velocity (`rad/s`) and frequency (`Hz` = `1/s`) are the same type.  WhippyUnits gives angle its own dimension, catching this class of bugs at compile time, while still providing ergonomic `.into()` erasure for standard trig function interop
- **Simple declarator syntaxes**: Supports declarator methods (`5.0.meters()`), macros (`quantity!(5.0, m)`), and even literals (`5.0m`)
- **Algebraic unit expressions**: Easily define quantities in complex/bespoke dimensionalities, e.g. `quantity!(1, V*s^2/m)`, complete with "smart" documentation via hover info on the passed-in unit identifiers
- **Algebraic dimension expressions**: Define scale-generic dimension traits for bespoke dimensions as easily as you can define quantities, e.g. `define_generic_dimension!(BespokeQuantity, V*T^2/L)`, also with "smart" documentation via hover info on the passed-in dimension identifiers.  Generic dimensions can be disjunctive, e.g. for control algorithms that work with a variety of process variables and control outputs.
- **UCUM support**: Unit expressions, dimensions expressions, and quantity (de)serialization all support UCUM-format unit strings (e.g. `"kg.m2/s2"`) for easy interoperability and code generation
- **Automatic unit conversion**: Type-driven generic rescaling using compile-time-computed conversion factors
- **Branded quantities**: Use `define_unit_declarators!` to create branded declarator sets that prevent accidental mixing across semantic contexts (e.g. different coordinate frames)
- **Dynamic storage unit preferences**: Use `define_unit_declarators!` to define a set of declarators that auto-convert to a given set of base units, fully decoupling storage scale (which can be chosen to satisfy numerical or software architecture constraints) from declarator syntax (which can match the natural units of the problem-space)
- **Serde support**: Serialize and deserialize quantities to JSON and string formats with UCUM-compliant unit strings (e.g. `{"value": 5.0, "unit": "m"}`)
- **`no_std` and `no_alloc` compatible**: Disable the default `std` feature for embedded and `no_std` environments
- **Language server integration**: WhippyUnits ships an LSP proxy and a CLI pretty-printer that render `Quantity` types as human-readable unit expressions in hover info, inlay hints, and compiler errors

## Example

```rust
// simple declarative syntax for standard quantities
let distance = 5.0.meters();
// or...
let distance = quantity!(5.0, m);
// or, in annotated context (see section on literals below)...
let distance = 5.0m;

// multiplication tracks dimensions
let area = 5.0m * 5.0m;
// or...
let area = quantity!(5.0 * 5.0, m^2);

// composite unit expressions support both "traditional" and UCUM-compliant
// notation, and even allow mixed notation within a single expression:
let energy = quantity!(5.0, kg.m2/s2);
let energy = quantity!(5.0, kg*m2/s2);
let energy = quantity!(5.0, kg*m^2/s^2);

// ✅ dimensionally coherent operations permitted
let legal = area + area;
// ❌ dimensionally incoherent operations generate compile-time error
let _illegal = area + distance;

// The generic `rescale` function makes multiscale addition both ergonomic and safe:

// result: 1.001 meters
let sum_in_meters = 1.0m + rescale(1.0mm);
// result: 1001.0 millimeters
let sum_in_millimeters = rescale(1.0m) + 1.0mm;
// result: ❌ compilation error (scale incoherence)
let illegal_sum = 1.0m + 1.0mm;
```

## Scale-Generic Calculations

The `define_generic_dimension!` macro makes it easy to write contracts that are generic over scale while maintaining dimensional coherence guarantees.  Generic dimension traits for each "primitive" dimension (mass, length, etc) are pre-defined for convenience in the default declarator package.

```rust
use core::ops::Mul;
use whippyunits::define_generic_dimension;

// define scale-generic dimension trait Area, representing a product of lengths
define_generic_dimension!(Area, Length^2);

// calculates an area from two lengths of generic dimension
fn area<D1: Length, D2: Length>(d1: D1, d2: D2) -> <D1 as Mul<D2>>::Output
where
    D1: Mul<D2>,
{
    d1 * d2
}

// regardless of input/output scales, the return type will always satisfy the Area trait
let millimeters_squared: impl Area = area(1.0mm, 1.0mm);
let meters_squared: impl Area = area(1.0m, 1.0m);
// This works too; it will return a concrete type of milli(meters^2), 
// since mm * m = (1/1000)(meters^2)
let mixed_units: impl Area = area(1.0mm, 1.0m);

// the generic dimension DSL expresses arbitrary dimensional algebra, 
// so all derived units can be covered
define_generic_dimension!(Energy, Mass * Length^2 / Time^2)
```

## Declarator Literals

Literal declarators are available in `default_declarators::literals`.  They can be used
in scopes tagged with the `#[culit::culit(whippyunits::default_declarators::literals)]` attribute:

```rust
#[culit::culit(whippyunits::default_declarators::literals)]
fn example() {
    let distance = 100.0m; // 100.0 meters (f64)
    let mass = 10g;        // 10 grams (i32)
    let energy = 1.0J_f32; // 1 joule (f32)
}
```

For more information on literal declarators, see the [culit](https://crates.io/crates/culit) crate.

## Imperial and Affine Declarators

Imperial units with automatic SI conversion:

```rust
let length = 12.0.inches();     // converts to centimeters
let mass = 2.0.pounds();        // converts to kilograms
let temp = 32.0.fahrenheit();   // converts to kelvin (affine)
```

Affine quantities (like temperature) handle zero-point offsets automatically. Celsius and Fahrenheit are stored as Kelvin internally with proper conversion factors.

## Unit-safe value access

The `value!` macro provides unit-safe access to the underlying numeric value of a quantity:

```rust
let distance = quantity!(1.0, m);
// because we explicitly tell the compiler the intended unit, this access is *unit-safe*;
// it cannot surprise us with a wrong scale, and it cannot be dimensionally incoherent
let value: f64 = value!(distance, m);
assert_eq!(value, 1.0);
// when the storage scale differs from the specified unit, the value will be rescaled:
let value: f64 = value!(distance, mm);
assert_eq!(value, 1000.0);
// ❌ if the specified unit is a different dimension, the macro will compile error:
let _value: f64 = value!(distance, s);
```

Direct access to the `.unsafe_value` field is not unit-safe, and should be used with caution - because whippyunits represents storage scales as part of its type system, the actual numeric value may not match the user's intent:

```rust
let dimensionless_ratio = 1.0.meters() / 1.0.millimeters();
// Because scale info is stored as part of the type, 
// unsafe value access may have unexpected behavior:
assert_eq!(dimensionless_ratio.unsafe_value, 1.0); // ⚠️
// safe access via erasure (see section below) gives the expected result:
assert_eq!(dimensionless_ratio.into(), 1000.0); // ✅
```

Accordingly, it is best practice when possible to use the `value!` macro or a legal unit-safe erasure (see below) to access the underlying numeric value of a quantity.  Whippyunits conversions are generally well-optimized, and in the majority of cases safe access should be zero- (or nearly-zero-) cost.  Direct access via `.unsafe_value` is a method-of-last-resort, and should only be used (carefully!) if unit-safe access is not possible for performance or safety reasons.

## Erasure to numeric types

Dimensionless and angular quantities are erasable, meaning they may be safely converted to and from numeric types without loss of information via `.into()`:

```rust
// dividing two same-unit quantities yields a dimensionless quantity
let from_dimensionless: f64 = (1.0.meters()/1.0.meters()).into();
assert_eq!(from_dimensionless, 1.0);

let from_radians: f64 = 1.0.radians().into();
assert_eq!(from_radians, 1.0);
```

An angular or dimensionless quantity with a non-unity storage scale - that is, a ratio of differently-scaled quantities of the same dimension, or an angular unit other than radians - will rescale to unity before erasure:

```rust
// division leaves a "residual scale" of (2^3 * 5^3) = 1000.0 in the type;
// but is a runtime noop, so direct access can give surprising results:
assert_eq!((1.0.meters()/1.0.millimeters()).unsafe_value, 1.0); // ⚠️
// with rescaling-on-erasure, unit-safe access gives the semantically-correct result:
assert_eq!((1.0.meters()/1.0.millimeters()).into(), 1000.0); // ✅

// similarly, we might get surprising results for non-radian angular quantities:
assert_eq!(f64::sin(90.0.degrees().unsafe_value), 0.89); // ⚠️
// the same mechanism ensures angular erasure is semantically-correct
// (i.e. always in radian-scale):
assert_eq!(f64::sin(90.0.degrees().into()), 1.0); // ✅
```

Erasure is permitted to convert to any numeric type; when combined with custom literals (see below), this naturally extends standard library trigonometric functions to have unit-safe, scale-appropriate interfaces:

```rust
let sin_value: f64 = f64::sin(90deg.into());
assert_eq!(sin_value, 1.0);
```

## Compound angular unit erasure

Compound units can also automatically erase their radian component (if present) via `.into()`, making it easy to deal with situations where the angular component is useful in some parts of the calculation but not others:

```rust
// if curvature occurs in the context of angular-change-per-distance, 
// it is natural to define it in units of radians per meter:
let curvature = quantity!(1.0, rad / m);
let velocity = quantity!(1.0, m / s);
// but when we want to calculate centripetal acceleration by the typical formula, 
// we need to erase the radian component:
let centripetal_acceleration: qty!(m / s^2) = (curvature * velocity * velocity).into();
assert_eq!(value!(centripetal_acceleration, m / s^2), 1.0);
```

Note that compound unit erasure only erases powers of pure radians; "residual scales" of non-radian units will be retained.  However, a simple rescale operation will recover the expected scale:

```rust
// we may have concrete measurements of angle in degrees; 
// we can still use the radian-scale quantity for the calculation:
let curvature = quantity!(1.0, deg / m);
let velocity = quantity!(1.0, m / s);
// because degrees have a non-unity storage scale, 
// we need to rescale to get the expected result:
let centripetal_acceleration: qty!(m / s^2) = rescale((curvature * velocity * velocity).into());
// 1 deg/m * (1 m/s)^2 = π/180 m/s^2
assert_eq!(value!(centripetal_acceleration, m / s^2), std::f64::consts::PI / 180.0);
```

## Scale-preferenced declarators

Use the `define_unit_declarators!` macro to define a local declarator syntax that obeys a given set of base SI scale preferences for storage:

```rust
define_unit_declarators!(
    Kilogram,
    // local_scale declarators will use millimeters instead of meters
    Millimeter,
    Second,
    Ampere,
    Kelvin,
    Mole,
    Candela,
    Radian,
    local_scale
);

// local scale literals are available in the "literals" module of the local_scale scope
#[culit::culit(local_scale::literals)]
fn example() {
    // trait declarators and the quantity! macro are available in the module
    use local_scale::*;
    let distance = 1.0.meters();      // automatically stores as 1000.0 millimeters
    let distance = quantity!(1.0, m); // so does this
    let distance = 1.0m;              // and so does this!

    // compound/derived units are "lifted" to the provided scale preferences
    let energy = 1.0J; // kg * mm^2 / s^2 yields microJoules, so this stores as 1000.0 * 1000.0 microJoules
}
```

The "smart" DSL documentation via hover info on the passed-in unit identifiers and literals is reactive to changes in the base units.  When base units have been changed, in addition to the typical
type information, the hover info on unit identifiers will display the unit to which that unit
is lifted in the local scope, along with a thorough trace of the conversion chain of *every*
unit identifier in the expression to its equivalent in the local base units.

```rust
define_unit_declarators!(
    Kilogram, Millimeter, Second, Ampere, Kelvin, Mole, Candela, Radian, local_scale
);

let local_watt = local_scale::quantity!(100.0, J / s);
```

Hovering over the `J` identifier will show the local equivalent of the unit, as
well as a thorough trace of the conversion chain of the aggregate quantity to its
equivalent in the local base units:

```rust
test_local_quantity
type LocalJ = whippyunits::default_declarators::Microjoule
size = 8, align = 0x8, no Drop
```
```
J / s → µJ / s = µW

Transformations:
J = kg^1 * m^2 * s^-2
↓ (length: m → mm, factor: 10^-3)
↓ (exponent: 2, total factor: 10^-6)
= kg^1 * mm^2 * s^-2
= µJ

s (no change)
```

## Human-readable display and debug format

```rust
println!("{}", 5.0m); 
// (5.0) Quantity<m, f64>
println!("{:?}", 5.0m); 
// (5.0) Quantity<meter [length¹], f64>

// Even handles complex SI values with correct aggregate-power-of-10 prefixing:
let microjoule = quantity!(1.0, kg * mm^2 / s^2);
println!("{}", microjoule);
// (1.0) Quantity<μJ, f64>
println!("{:?}", microjoule);
// (1.0) Quantity<microJoule (Energy) [2⁻⁶, 5⁻⁶] [mass¹, length², time⁻²], f64>
```

## Print Format with Rescaling

Format quantities in any compatible unit with automatic conversion:

```rust
println!("{}", 5.0km.fmt("miles"));     // "3.1068559611866697 mi"
println!("{}", 5.0ft.fmt("feet"));      // "16404.199475065616 ft"

// With precision control using format specifiers
println!("{:.2}", 5.0km.fmt("miles")); // "3.11 mi"
```

## CLI Pretty Printer

The `whippyunits-pretty` tool provides type prettyprinting in compiler errors:

```rust
// Example output after prettifying:
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> tests/compile_fail/add_length_to_time.rs:10:28
   |
10 |     let _result = length + time;
   |                            ^^^^ expected `1`, found `0`
   |
   = note: expected struct `Quantity<m, f64>`
              found struct `Quantity<s, f64>`

// Without prettifying (raw compiler output):
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> tests/compile_fail/add_length_to_time.rs:10:28
   |
10 |     let _result = length + time;
   |                            ^^^^ expected `1`, found `0`
   |
   = note: expected struct `Quantity<Unit<Scale, Dimension<_M, _L<1>, _T<0>, _I, _Θ, _N, _J, _A>>>`
              found struct `Quantity<Unit<Scale, Dimension<_M, _L<0>, _T<1>, _I, _Θ, _N, _J, _A>>>`
```

The tool converts complex generic type parameters into human-readable unit symbols, making error messages much clearer.

## LSP Proxy

The `lsp-proxy/` directory contains a Language Server Protocol proxy that intercepts rust-analyzer responses to enhance type display. It:

* pretty-prints Quantity types in human-readable form matching the `debug` trait behavior...
    * verbosely in hover info, including best-effort interpretation of partially-resolved types:
        ```rust
        let result: Quantity<meter [length¹], f64>

        ---
        Raw:

        result: Quantity<Unit<Scale, Dimension<_M<0>, _L<1>>>>
        ---

        size = 8, align = 0x8, no Drop
        ```
    * tersely in inlay hints with backing datatype suffix (also including best-effort interpretation...):
        ```rust
        //          v inlay hint
        let distance: Quantity<m, f64> = 5.0mm;
        ```
* replaces literal Quantity text completions with equivalent `unit!` macro declarations
    ```rust
    //          v inlay hint (like above)
    let distance: Quantity<m, f64> = 5.0mm;
    //          double-clicks into correct macro declaration syntax for the unit!
    let distance: qty!(m) = 5.0mm;
    ```

See `lsp-proxy/README.md` for setup instructions.

## Requirements

WhippyUnits works on **stable Rust**, using a typenum-based polyfill for compile-time dimensional arithmetic. Dimension and scale exponents are limited to the range -200 to 200.

## Feature Flags

| Feature | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `std`   | Yes     | Enables standard library support (implies `alloc`) |
| `alloc` | Yes     | Enables `Display`/`Debug` impls on `Quantity` (requires a global allocator) |
| `serde` | Yes     | Enables serde `Serialize`/`Deserialize` impls, `from_json!`/`from_string!` macros, and the `.fmt()` display method (implies `alloc`) |

## `no_std` and `no_alloc` Support

WhippyUnits is fully `no_std` and `no_alloc` compatible. All core functionality — quantity declaration, dimensional/scale safety, arithmetic, rescaling, erasure, and generic dimensions — works without the standard library or a heap allocator.

```toml
# no_std + no_alloc (stack-only, no Display/Debug)
[dependencies]
whippyunits = { version = "0.3", default-features = false }

# no_std + alloc (adds Display/Debug impls)
[dependencies]
whippyunits = { version = "0.3", default-features = false, features = ["alloc"] }

# no_std + alloc + serde
[dependencies]
whippyunits = { version = "0.3", default-features = false, features = ["serde"] }
```

**What you lose without `alloc`:**

- No `Display` or `Debug` trait impls on `Quantity` (cannot `println!` quantities)

**What you additionally lose without `serde`:**

- No `Serialize`/`Deserialize` trait impls on `Quantity`
- No `from_json!` / `from_string!` macros
- No `.fmt("unit")` display method for runtime unit conversion formatting
